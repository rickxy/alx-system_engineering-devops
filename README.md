# Shell Basics

The shell scripts in this repository cover the essentials of shell scripting. Each script focuses on a certain activity or idea and offers helpful illustrations and explanations. The scripts may be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and are written in Bash.


## Scripts

- `0-current_working_directory`: prints the name of the current working directory's absolute path.

- `1-listit`: Displays the contents list of the current directory.

Please feel free to browse the repository and run the scripts to gain a deeper understanding of the foundations of shell scripting.
